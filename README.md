# JH_Robotics_Kin_Dyn

This project was my term project for the Kinematics and Dynamics of Robots course at Johns Hopkins University.

The main script is Headland_Term_Project_v5.m and requires the other included function files.

The goal of this project was to calculate joint angles for each joint of a 6 degree of freedom
UR5 robot using piece-wise torque profiles generated for each joint. To do this, the general equations
of motions for a robot are modeled and solved with ODE45. The joint angle as a function of time information
generated by the script is used simulate the motion of the robot.
